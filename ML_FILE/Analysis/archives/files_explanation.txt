This repository (archive) gather some files that are no longer used to create the models, but that
where used to search for the best model, you can still explore the files to see how research was done,
and why some features/ ways have been selected and not others. You can use these files as a basis 
for developing new models.
You can also explore theses files if you want to try different methods to create models, thus you can 
take some methods from these files

-- Gyr_analysis_chaos : 
gather different features transformation, and different tests that have been done to see the utility
of these transformations, 
for examples there has been tests carried out taking the sinus of roll, pitch
yaw angles, to suppress the "gap effects" when something goes from 180 to -180 deg suddenly.
With this file, you can also explore some visual analysis (as plot of multiple curves).



-- Original acc/gyr analysis_AI
The non simplified files of Acc_analysis_AI_simplified and Gyr_analysis_AI_simplified, you can find others
methods explored on these files, as the rolling window method (consist of applying function on a fixed number
of previous samples).
